# ML-Python---World-Happiness-Index

Title: World Happiness Index

Introduction:
In this project, I explored world happiness levels using Python and R, aiming to create an interactive visualization based on the 2021 World Happiness Report. Let's delve into the data and discover insights together.

Data Collection:
I collected the 2021 World Happiness Report data, including GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy, laying the foundation for analysis.

Data Refinement:
To ensure accuracy, I cleaned the data by handling missing values and standardizing formats.

Visualization Techniques:
Utilizing Python's libraries, I crafted:
- World Map: Visualizing regional happiness scores.
- Bar Charts: Comparing country scores.
- Correlation Matrix: Examining relationships between happiness and factors.
- Line Charts: Illustrating trends over multiple years.

Machine Learning Exploration:
Adding depth, I employed machine learning models:
- Linear Regression: Predicting happiness scores.
- Random Forest Regressor: Capturing complex data relationships.
- Decision Tree Model: Analyzing data structures for insights.
- Ensemble Learning: Enhancing predictive accuracy.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model: Recognizing patterns and regressions.

Insights:
Unveiling key findings, including:
- Identification of happiest countries.
- Understanding factors influencing happiness.
- Tracking happiness changes over time.

Conclusion:
This project showcases my data visualization skills, making complex data accessible. Explore more on my portfolio site for deeper insights into global happiness trends, including the role of machine learning in understanding happiness patterns.
